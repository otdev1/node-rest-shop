This API implements some of the operations that are associated with a typical merchant shop and I built it to showcase my skills in API development. 
It is lightweight and uses the Mongoose object data modeling library to facilitate interaction with a MongoDB database. 
Requests and responses sent to and from it are in JSON format.
